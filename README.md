# What is this?

[![This project is using Percy.io for visual regression testing.](https://percy.io/static/images/percy-badge.svg)](https://percy.io/Pavey-Dev/loremoji)

Multi Ipsum is a random placeholder text generator with built-in emoji-centric enhancements.
Why would you want to fill you WIP project with boring Lorem Ipsum - which isn't even multibyte - when you could instead keep it modern and fill it with a mixture of random, meaningless sentences, and the odd emoji.

## How do I use it?

Just visit the site, choose how much text you want, and if you want emojis, and hit the _Generate_ button.

You will get some randomly generated text, sprinkled with emojis.
